I recommended to use this script for who loves a bookmarklet.
This script provides are:
  * Can load javascript sequentially.
  * Can load the major CDN libraries easily that are already defined in this script.
  * Can load an any CDN library dynamically.
  * Can store/restore/load the CDN libraries with using the your localStorage that is provided by the architecture of HTML5.

I recommended to use this script to who loves a bookmarklet.
This script provides are:
  * Can load javascript sequentially.
  * Can load the major CDN libraries easily that are already defined in this script.
  * Can load an any CDN library dynamically.
  * Can store/restore/load the CDN libraries with using the your localStorage that is provided by the architecture of HTML5.


If you need to use this script on your Browser, you can choose either way  bellow.
- Add to bookmark this script as bookmarklet then perform it. 
- Add to your html as script.
